<h1>Law School Personal Statement</h1>
<body>
    <div>
        <p>Hello, my name is David Fuell. I have decided to apply to Law School at the University of Kansas. KU Law stands as my top choice for pursuing my legal education, drawing me in with its small class sizes, faculty specialties, and the school's community involvement through the pro bono program. I want to attend law school because I deeply desire to serve others, participate in justice in my community, and be an attorney who can counsel and advise others with important decisions.</p>
        <p>I've always been interested in justice and service from a young age. This fascination for justice and service persisted through adolescence, leading me to embark on a religious mission in Colombia at age 18. In Colombia, I faced the challenge of communicating in a foreign language, an experience that instilled empathy and shaped my understanding of linguistic barriers. Having achieved fluency in Spanish, I utilize my language proficiency to facilitate communication and assist minority clients in banking and military settings. In Colombia, I actively contributed to the community, teaching financial self-reliance courses, participating in home-building projects, and assuming leadership roles among my missionary peers.</p>
        <p>Upon returning from Colombia, I wanted to continue serving others, which led me to enlist in the U.S. Navy Reserves as an Intelligence Specialist (IS). Through this position, I attained a security clearance to handle classified information. The attainment of this clearance speaks to my character in that the U.S. government trusts me to handle top-secret information. Completing thorough analysis and advising decision-makers on critical military decisions are among the most rewarding aspects of working as an IS. Having researched the legal profession, the skills I've gained as an IS would be highly beneficial in a legal setting.</p>
        <p>Increasing rank to enlisted leadership positions in the Navy can take several years. Within two years, I attained the rank of Petty Officer Second Class, subsequently assuming roles as assistant team lead and later team lead for unit operations within a short period after promotion. These experiences highlight my proactive pursuit of leadership roles and demonstrate my reliability as someone other leaders trust to effectively guide teams toward success.</p>
        <p>At Utah State University (USU), I embraced rigorous coursework, extracurricular involvement, and leadership roles in various clubs and organizations. Despite the demands of academia, I diligently prioritized my studies while concurrently managing multiple part-time jobs. In addition to excelling academically, my family and I were also subject to overcoming a challenging personal scenario. My wife's experience as a crime victim on campus reinforced my resolve to seek justice and deepened my desire for involvement with the legal system.</p>
        <p>While at USU, I also acquired a position as a teller and later a loan officer for Mountain America Credit Union (MACU). I was grateful for the insights MACU gave me into the global market changes due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. At MACU, I was privileged to serve Spanish-speaking immigrants seeking financial knowledge and guidance. These experiences initially were quite complicated due to the necessity to often explain U.S. financial frameworks compared to originating nations in Spanish. I eventually found these experiences rewarding due to what I learned the U.S. offers its citizens and constituents financially. The experience of working in banking helped me grow an appreciation for financial institutions and how the laws and regulations protect ordinary people while giving businesses and individuals opportunities to improve their lives temporally and fiscally.</p>
        <p>Amidst the complexities of my final semester at USU, I received a call to fulfill an assignment with the U.S. Navy Reserve on active-duty title 10 orders. Balancing military obligations with academic responsibilities required meticulous time management and organization. Despite these challenges, I completed my bachelor's degrees in finance and economics, equipped with resilience and determination for law school and beyond.</p>
        <p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I received admission to the nation's inaugural Masters of Anticipatory Intelligence at USU. This program has equipped me with a multidomain perspective on anticipating threats and opportunities arising from the ever-evolving security landscape worldwide. It has significantly influenced my approach to problem-solving, fostering an appreciation for nuances and the consideration of third, or even fourth-order effects. In the program I was hand selected from among my peers to participate in a security consultation for an up-and-coming software company where we provided insight into their companies security outlook. Through my own initiative and communication with faculty I completed an outline for a future course for graduate students in the master’s program.</p>
        <p>I currently serve the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) as a Counter Threat Finance Analyst in an active-duty military capacity. In my service with USSOUTHCOM, I employ knowledge of Spanish and South American culture learned from my time in Colombia. Moreover, I apply the knowledge of finance and economics I attained in my undergraduate degrees. Additionally, I have participated in the justice process by assisting law enforcement agencies, both domestically and internationally, to hold transnational criminals and organizations responsible for their criminal activity and support authorities’ organization of information for extradition of criminals to the U.S.</p>
        <p>My academic and professional aspirations center around obtaining a J.D. specializing in real estate, corporate law, or international law, particularly within federal government or agency roles. My experiences in Colombia, the military, and various occupations have fueled my desire to play an active role in addressing national issues. I aim to provide legal counsel to federal leaders, ensuring adherence to constitutional principles and the public good.</p>
        <p>As I stated before, I want to attend law school because I deeply desire to serve others, participate in justice in my community, and be an attorney who can counsel and advise others with important decisions. I am determined to pursue a career in law despite the challenges ahead, and I am confident that my unique qualities and skills will distinguish me as an excellent attorney. I have what it takes to be an outstanding member of the legal profession, well-educated in the law, and committed to professional achievement and public service. I am prepared to excel in law school by actively seeking opportunities for growth, networking, and development to succeed both in academia and the legal profession.</p>
